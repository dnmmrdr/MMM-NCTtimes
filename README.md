# MMM-NCTtimes
This is a Module for the [Magic Mirror Project](https://magicmirror.builders/) that displays bus times for bus stops that belong to [Nottingham City Transport](https://nctx.co.uk). The module gets the info by using the axios and cheerio nodejs libraries and scraping the NCT website, as they do not provide an API. This Module aims to look similar in format to the live displays used at the physical bus stops around Nottingham, whilst still remaining in style with the other default MagicMirror modules.
